i learned comparison can be directly done through cons9ole.log 
Eg; copnsole.log(10==10); //Prints true


to ask something to the user,

const readlineSync = require(readline-sync);
const number = Number(readlineSync.question("Enter a number: ));
const apple = readlineSync.question("Whats your name: );

TERNARY

condition ? console.log : condition ? console.log : console.log

LOGICAL

AND &&
OR ||
NOT !
NULLISH COALESCING ??

idk what to write after this.
